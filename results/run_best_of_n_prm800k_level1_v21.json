                "## Step 1\nGiven the diagram, we need to find the length of DE. To start solving this problem, we should focus on the right-angled triangle DEF. We're given that sin(D) = 0.7, which is the ratio of the side opposite angle D to the side adjacent to angle D.\n\n## Step 2\nSince angle D is a right angle, its sine is simply the ratio of the side opposite angle D to the hypotenuse. Therefore, we can write the equation: sin(D) = opposite side / hypotenuse = 0.7. The opposite side is DE, and the hypotenuse is DF.\n\n## Step 3\nAs the sine of angle D is 0.7, we can set up an equation: DE / DF = 0.7. Since we're given that DF = 7, we can substitute this value into the equation, which gives us DE / 7 = 0.7.\n\n## Step 4\nBy multiplying both sides of the equation by 7, we can isolate DE, resulting in DE = 0.7 * 7. This will give us the length of DE.\n\n## Step 5\nPerforming the multiplication gives us DE = 4.9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4.9}$",
                "## Step 1:  To find the length of $DE$, we first need to understand the given information and set up a strategy for solving the problem.\n## Step 2:  We're given that $\\sin D = 0.7$ in the diagram, and we want to find the length of $DE$. This suggests that we might need to use trigonometric relationships to solve the problem.\n## Step 3:  Looking at the right-angled triangle $DEF$, we can see that $\\sin D$ is the ratio of the opposite side ($DE$) to the hypotenuse ($DF$), while $\\cos D$ is the ratio of the adjacent side ($DE$) to the hypotenuse ($DF$).\n## Step 4:  We can use the identity $\\sin^2 D + \\cos^2 D = 1$ to find the length of $DE$. Substituting the given value of $\\sin D$, we get $\\left(\\frac{7}{7}\\right)^2 + \\cos^2 D = 1$.\n## Step 5:  We'll simplify this equation to find the length of $DE$. Starting with $\\left(\\frac{7}{7}\\right)^2$, we find that this simplifies to $1$. The equation now becomes $1 + \\cos^2 D = 1$.\n## Step 6:  By subtracting $1$ from both sides, we obtain $\\cos^2 D = 0$. Taking the square root of both sides gives us $\\cos D = 0$. This means that angle $D$ is a right angle.\n## Step 7:  Understanding that $D$ is a right angle tells us that $\\cos D = \\cos 90^\\circ = 0$. This is a key insight because we can now use the right triangle $DEF$ to find the length of $DE$.\n## Step 8:  Since $DEF$ is a right triangle, we can apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $DE$. The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n## Step 9:  Using this theorem, we find that $DE = \\sqrt{DF^2 - DE^2}$. We know that $DF = 7$ and we can substitute this value into the equation.\n## Step 10:  Substituting the values into the equation gives us $DE = \\sqrt{7^2 - DE^2}$.\n## Step 11:  Simplifying further, we get $DE = \\sqrt{49 - DE^2}$.\n## Step 12:  We can solve this equation for $DE^2$ by rearranging it to $DE^2 + 49 = DE^2$, and then subtracting $DE^2$ from both sides.\n## Step 13:  This gives us $49 = 0$, which we can simplify to $DE^2 = 49$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find that $DE = \\boxed{7}$.\n## Step 14:  Therefore, the length of $DE$ is $\\boxed{7}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",

Since $\\sin D = \\frac{DE}{DF}$, we can deduce that $DE = 0.7 \\cdot DF$.\n## Step 3:  According to the Pythagorean theorem, in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, we have $DF^2 + DE^2 = EF^2$.\n## Step 4:  Substituting $DE = 0.7 \\cdot DF$ into the equation, we get $DF^2 + (0.7 \\cdot DF)^2 = EF^2$. This simplifies to $1.49 \\cdot DF^2 = EF^2$.\n## Step 5:  Using the given information that $DF = 7$, we can substitute this value into the equation to solve for $EF^2$. This yields $1.49 \\cdot 7^2 = EF^2$.\n## Step 6:  Calculating the value of $1.49 \\cdot 7^2$, we find $EF^2 = 1.49 \\cdot 49 = 72.1$.\n## Step 7:  Finally, taking the square root of $72.1$, we get $EF = \\sqrt{72.1} \\approx 8.486$.

The value of x - (x - x)3 is (x - (x - x)3).\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the result of the expression\n(x - (x - x)3) = (x - 0) = x.\n\n## Step 5: Try to solve x\nIf x = 3, then Zach has 3 pencils and would have to distribute 0, 1, or 2 pencils each bag.\n\n## Step 6: Check possible solutions\nWe need to check solutions of the expression x = 2, x = 3 and see if they are correct.\n\n## Step 7: Check if x = 2 is correct\nx = 2, then Zach has 2 pencils and would have to distribute 1 or 0 pencils each bag. 2 is not divisible by 3.\n\n## Step 8: Check if x = 3 is correct\nx = 3, then Zach has 3 pencils and would have to distribute 0, 1, or 2 pencils each bag. x = 3 is divisible by 3.\n\n## Step 9: Check if x = 4 is correct\nx = 4, then Zach has 4 pencils and would have to distribute 0, 1, or 2 pencils each bag. 4 is divisible by 3.\n\n## Step 10: Check final solution\nWe'll calculate the remainder when each x is divided by 3, and check if there is any valid solution.\n\n## Step 11: Check if x = 3 is the greatest valid number of pencils in each bag.\n2, 3 and 4 have the same remainder when divided by 3. So, x = 3 is the greatest number of pencils Zach has that he can put in the bags while keeping the number of pencils in each bag the same.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the remainder of x = 3 when divided by 3.\nRemainder of (x = 3) = 3 divided by 3 equals 1.\n\n## Step 13: Check final solution\nWe'll calculate the remainder when each x is divided by 3, and check if there is any valid solution.\n\n## Step 14: Check if x = 2 is the greatest valid number of pencils in each bag.\n2 has a remainder of 2 when divided by 3 and 4 has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.\n\n## Step 15: Check if x = 1 is the greatest valid number of pencils in each bag.\n1 has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.\n\n## Step 16: Check if x = 0 is the greatest valid number of pencils in each bag.\n0 has a remainder of 0 when divided by 3.\n\n## Step 17: Check the possible solutions of x = 3.\nX = 3 is a valid solution.\n\n## Step 18: Check if x = 4 is the greatest valid solution.\nX = 4 is a valid solution.\n\n## Step 19: Compare valid x values\nx = 3 is the greatest valid solution that Zach can put in the bags.\n\n## Step 20: Analyze the final valid solution\nSince 3 has the highest remainder of 1 when divided by 3, that means Zach can put the greatest number of pencils in each bag (3). After putting 3 in each bag, the number of pencils left over is 3 - 3*3.\n\n## Step 21: Calculate the remainder of 3 - 3*3 when divided by 3\nRemainder of 3 - 3*3 = 0.\n\n## Step 22: Check if there is any valid solution\nSince there is no valid solution other than x = 3, the answer is 0.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",
                "## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem\nZach has three bags and a certain number of pencils to distribute evenly into each bag. The goal is to minimize the leftover pencils.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the minimum number of pencils to distribute evenly into each bag\nSince there are three bags, the minimum number of pencils to distribute evenly into each bag would be the smallest multiple of 3 (the number of bags) that is greater than or equal to the total number of pencils. However, since Zach also wants to keep the number of pencils in each bag the same, we need to consider a scenario where he distributes the smallest possible amount of pencils to each bag.\n\n## Step 3: Distribute the pencils into the bags while keeping the number the same\nTo minimize the leftover pencils, Zach should evenly distribute the pencils. Since there are three bags, he could give 1 pencil to each bag to have a total of 3 pencils.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of pencils given to the bags\nZach has 3 bags, and he has distributed 3 pencils to each bag, so the total number of pencils given to the bags is 3 * 3 = 9 pencils.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of leftover pencils\nZach started with a certain number of pencils, let's call it 'x'. Since he distributed 9 pencils to the bags, we can set up the equation: x = 3 * 3 = 9.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for x to find the number of leftover pencils\nx = 9, so the number of leftover pencils is 9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",

                "## Step 1: Identify the constraint\nZach has three bags, and he needs to distribute an equal number of pencils into each bag while keeping the total number of pencils the same.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the minimum number of pencils per bag\nSince Zach needs to keep the number of pencils in each bag the same, the minimum number of pencils per bag will be the smallest number that allows him to distribute the pencils evenly into three groups with the same quantity.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the minimum number of pencils per bag\nTo find the minimum number of pencils per bag, we consider 1 as the minimum number since it is the smallest number that can be evenly divided into three parts without leaving any remainder.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the remaining pencils after the minimum distribution\nSince Zach has a total of 3 * 1 = 3 pencils and can distribute them evenly into three bags, 1 pencil per bag, he will have 3 - 3 = 0 pencils left over after the minimum distribution.\n\n## Step 5: Confirm the solution\nWith 0 pencils left over, this distribution meets the given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"

From step 3, we know that 300 = 4d, so divide both sides by 4 to find that d = 300 / 4 = 75. Now we can plug this value of d into the equation for the sixth term.\n\n## Step 9\nInsert d = 75 into the equation for t6: t6 = t1 + 1500.\n\n## Step 10\nWe know that t8 = t1 + 7d.

This means that the angle subtended by arc $JO$ at the center of the circle is twice the angle subtended by arc $HN$ at the center of the circle.\n## Step 5:  Let $m\\angle HNO$ represent the measure of the angle subtended by arc $HN$ at the center of the circle.

Let's call this common measure $x$. Therefore, we have $m\\angle HNO = x$. Using the relationship $m\\angle JOH = 2m\\angle HNO$, we find that $m\\angle JNO = 2x$.\n## Step 11:  Since $m\\angle JNO = m\\angle HNO = m\\angle HNO = 90 - m\\angle J$, we have $2x = 90 - m\\angle J$. Solving for $m\\angle J$, we get $m\\angle J = 45 - x$.\n## Step 12:  We can find the value of $x$ using the relationships between the angles. Since $m\\angle HNO = m\\angle HNO = x$, we have $2x = 90 - m\\angle J$. Substituting the value of $x$, we find that $x = 90 - m\\angle J$.\n## Step 13:  Now that we know that $x = 90 - m\\angle J$, we can find the value of $m\\angle J$ as $m\\angle J = 45 - x = 45 - (90 - m\\angle J)$.\n## Step 14:  Simplifying, we get $m\\angle J = 45 - 90 + m\\angle J$. Cancelling out the $m\\angle J$ term, we have $0 = -45$.

Therefore, 5 + 2 = 7 boxes contain pens and pencils.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of boxes containing only pens.\nThere are 4 boxes with pens that do not contain pencils. Therefore, 4 boxes contain only pens.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of boxes containing only pencils.\nThere are 5 boxes that contain pencils but 2 of them contain both pens and pencils.

Consider, the initial restriction was that every box that has any item from the list of items that items can be, but contains neither the item in the first list nor the item in the second.\nSince 7 are in the first two lists of pens and pencils. And 2 - contain both, lets just use the initial results from the steps and use a different approach to solve, by simply identifying boxes containing neither the pencil or the pen.\n\n## Step 9: Identify the boxes that contain neither pens nor pencils.\nSince there are 10 boxes in total, 10 - (4 + 5 + 2) = 10 - 11 = -1.  We cannot have a negative number of boxes. This indicates we made an error in the problem statement. The error is that it's impossible to have a negative number of boxes.\n\n## Step 10: Correct the error and re-solve.\nIf 5 boxes contain pencils and 4 boxes contain pens, that means 4 + 5 - 2 = 7 boxes have either pens or pencils (or both). So the number of boxes with neither pens nor pencils is 10 - 7 = 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"

Substituting G = 13n into the equation gives us 13n + B = 35.\n\n## Step 4: Find possible values of B (number of boys) that satisfy both the condition for the number of girls (G) and the total number of students.\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for B: B = 35 - 13n. Since B must be an integer and more than 13n, we need to find values of n such that B falls within the range of possible values that meet these conditions.\n\n## Step 5: Test different values of n to find the possible values of B that satisfy the conditions.\nStarting with n = 1, we get B = 22, which satisfies the condition of being more than 13n but doesn't meet the total count of 35.\nTrying n = 2, we get B = 12, which is within the range and satisfies the condition of being more than 13n.\n\n## Step 6: Conclude the number of boys based on the found values of B and the total number of students.\nGiven n = 2, we have B = 12. For n = 3, we get B = 9. Therefore, the possible number of boys (B) based on the total number of students and the condition for the number of girls is B = 12 or B = 9.\n\n## Step 7: Choose the appropriate solution based on the problem's conditions.\nThe problem states there are more girls than boys and 35 students in total. Since we have found two valid solutions (B = 12 or B = 9), we must select the one that best fits the problem.\n\n## Step 8:  Select the number of boys that is the correct answer to the problem.\nSince we have two potential values (B = 12 or B = 9), to choose between these, we must consider the constraints of the problem. We know there are 35 students and more girls than boys, which means B > G. Given G = 13n, the value of B must be higher than twice the value of n for n > 1. Therefore, to exactly match our scenario, n must be 2 (since B = 12 or B = 9 doesn't match both G = 13n and the condition that the total number of students equals 35).\n\n## Step 9: Select the final answer.\nBased on our calculations and analysis, we select the number of boys that meets the constraints of the problem, which is B = 9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",

We see that $x = 1$ is not a root.\n## Step 6:  Next, we substitute $x=2$ into the equation, giving us $2^4 + 5(2)^3 + 9(2)^2 - 2 - 14 = 16 + 40 + 36 - 2 - 14 = 88$. This shows that $x = 2$ is also not a root.\n## Step 7:  We continue this process for the remaining positive integers: $x = 7$ and $x = 14$.\n## Step 8:  Substituting $x = 7$ into the equation gives us $7^4 + 5(7)^3 + 9(7)^2 - 7 - 14 = 2401 + 1545 + 441 - 7 - 14 = 3846$. Clearly, $x = 7$ is not a root.\n## Step 9:  Then, substituting $x = 14$ into the equation gives us $14^4 + 5(14)^3 + 9(14)^2 - 14 - 14 = 38416 + 9800 + 1266 - 14 - 14 = 50074$.
