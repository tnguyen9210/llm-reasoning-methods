 '## Step 4:  The coefficient $b$ affects the frequency of the oscillation, '

 '## Step 6:  We can use this information to determine the value of $c.$ We '
 'know that the midline of the function is at $d.$ So, the distance from the '

 '## Step 7:  Since the graph oscillates between $1$ and $3,$ and we know that '

 'understand its behavior.\n'
 '## Step 9:  Since the graph oscillates between $1$ and $3,$ this means that '
 'the value of $d$ must be equal to $1,$ which indicates that the graph is '

 'graph of the sine function is affected by its phase shift, which includes '
 'the value of $c.$\n'
 '## Step 3:  In the standard form of the sine function, $y = \\sin (bx + c),$ '
 'the graph is shifted horizontally by an amount equal to $-c.$ This means '
 'that the graph of the given function will be shifted to the left by the '
 'absolute value of $c.$\n'
 '## Step 4:  The graph has a period of $2\\pi,$ meaning that it repeats every '
 '$2\\pi$ units in the $x$ direction. Therefore, the graph is shifted to the '

 "## Step 5:  Initially, the graph's period is $2\\pi,$ which corresponds to "

 'on this graph.\n'
 '## Step 2:  The graph oscillates between the values of $3$ and $-1$, and it '
 'has a period of $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, as observed from the graph.\n'
 '## Step 3:  We can use the properties of the sine function to understand how '
 '$c$ influences the position of the graph in the $x$-axis. Specifically, $c$ '
 'affects the phase shift of the function.\n'
 '## Step 4:  The period of the sine function is given by $\\frac{2\\pi}{b}$, '

 'up an equation to solve for $b$, which is $\\frac{2\\pi}{3} = '
 '\\frac{2\\pi}{b}.$\n'
 '## Step 5:  By solving for $b$, we find $b = 3.$ This is a critical piece of '
 'information as it allows us to understand how $b$ affects the position of '
 'the graph.\n'
 '## Step 6:  The value of $b$ is a key component in determining the phase '
 'shift of the graph, which in turn affects the minimum value of $c$ that '
 'satisfies the given conditions.\n'
 '## Step 7:  We know that the minimum value of $c$ is obtained when $y = a '
 '\\sin (bx + c) + d$ is at its minimum. This minimum value is equal to $-d$, '

 '$a$, period $\\frac{2\\pi}{b}$, phase shift $-\\frac{c}{b}$, and vertical '
 'shift $d$.\n'

 '## Step 1:  The problem requires finding the smallest possible value of $c$ '
 'in the given graph of the function $y = a \\sin (bx + c) + d.$\n'
 '## Step 2:  The function is a periodic sine function with amplitude $|a|$, '
 'period $\\frac{2\\pi}{|b|}$, and vertical shift $d$.\n'
 '## Step 3:  Looking at the graph, we can see that the function has been '
 'shifted upwards by $1$ unit, meaning that $d = 1.$\n'
 '## Step 4:  To find the smallest possible value of $c,$ we need to look for '
 'the smallest rotation of the graph from its original position.\n'
 '## Step 5:  The graph shows a vertical shift upwards, and this value '
 'represents the vertical displacement of the graph from its original '
 'position.\n'
 '## Step 6:  We know that the maximum value of the function $y = a \\sin (bx '
 '+ c)$ is $|a|$, so the vertical displacement is the value of $a$.\n'
 '## Step 7:  Considering the graph, the vertical displacement is $2$ units, '
 'meaning that $a = 2.$\n'
 '## Step 8:  Since the maximum value of the function is $|a|,$ the smallest '
 'possible value of $c$ is the minimum rotation required to place the graph at '
 'its original position.\n'
 '## Step 9:  The minimum rotation is achieved by shifting the graph down by '
 'the value of $a$.\n'
 '## Step 10:  Thus, the smallest possible value of $c$ is $-2.$\n'
 '## Step 11:  Therefore, the final answer for the smallest possible value of '
 '$c$ is $\\boxed{-2}.$\n'
 '\n',
 '## Step 1:  The given graph represents a sine wave with a base frequency of '
 '$\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and an amplitude of $2$. The phase shift of the wave is '
 'given by the constant $c$ in the equation $y = a \\sin (bx + c) + d.$\n'
 '## Step 2:  To find the smallest possible value of $c$, we need to consider '
 'the characteristics of the sine function and the impact of the phase shift.\n'
 '## Step 3:  The phase shift represents how far the graph of the sine '
 'function is shifted to the right or left, and it is given by '
 '$-\\frac{c}{b}.$\n'
 "## Step 4:  In this case, we're given that $b = 3$, and we want to find the "
 'smallest possible value of $c$.\n'
 '## Step 5:  Since the graph completes one full cycle over an interval of '
 '$\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ units, the phase shift $c$ will be negative. Therefore, '
 'the smallest possible value of $c$ is $-\\frac{2\\pi}{3}.$\n'
 '## Step 6:  To verify this, we can find the phase shift using the given '
 'information. Since the amplitude is $2,$ the graph will be shifted to the '
 'left by $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}.$\n'
 '## Step 7:  Hence, the smallest possible value of $c$ is '
 '$\\boxed{-\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}.$\n'
 '\n',
 '## Step 1:  We are given the graph of a sine function in the form $y = a '
 '\\sin (bx + c) + d$ and are asked to find the smallest possible value of '
 '$c$.\n'
 '## Step 2:  The graph of the sine function has a period of '
 '$\\frac{2\\pi}{b}$. From the graph, we can observe that the period of the '
 'given function is $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, as is the case for the standard sine '
 'function $\\sin x$.\n'
 '## Step 3:  The standard period of $\\sin x$ is $2\\pi$, so to adjust the '
 'period of $\\sin bx$ to $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, we need to find the smallest '
 'value of $b$ such that $\\frac{2\\pi}{b} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$. This leads us '
 'to find $b$ in terms of the period.\n'
 '## Step 4:  Solving for $b$, we get $b = 3$.\n'
 '## Step 5:  Now that we know the period is $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, we can '
 'proceed to relate the period of the standard sine function to the graph of '
 'our sine function, using the phase shift to find the value of $c$ that '
 'minimizes it.\n'
 '## Step 6:  Since the graph of $\\sin (bx + c)$ starts at $-3$ and reaches '
 '$3$, we can set up an equation based on the equality of the two values.\n'
 '## Step 7:  Using the equation for the standard sine function, we can equate '
 '$-3$ to $2\\sin (3x + c)$ and determine the value of $c$ that minimizes the '
 'sine function.\n'
 '## Step 8:  Solving the equation, we find $c = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n'
 '## Step 9:  This means that the smallest possible value of $c$ is '
 '$\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n'
 '\n',
 '## Step 1:  The given function is in the form $y = a \\sin (bx + c) + d$, '
 'and we are asked to find the smallest possible value of $c.$\n'
 '## Step 2:  First, we need to understand the general behavior of the sine '
 'function and its impact on the graph.\n'
 '## Step 3:  The standard sine function oscillates between $-1$ and $1$. '
 'Therefore, the graph $y = a \\sin (bx + c) + d$ will oscillate between $d - '
 'a$ and $d + a.$\n'
 '## Step 4:  The amplitude of the graph is the distance from the center line '
 'to the peak (or trough). In this case, the amplitude is represented by $a.$\n'
 '## Step 5:  To minimize $c,$ we want the graph to start at its minimum '
 'value, which is $d - a.$ The smallest value $c$ can take is when the graph '
 'is shifted 180 degrees to the right, placing it on the line $y = d - a.$\n'
 '## Step 6:  This means we want the graph to oscillate around its minimum '
 'value while also aligning with the line $y = d - a.$\n'
 '## Step 7:  Since the graph oscillates between $d - a$ and $d + a,$ we '
 'should choose $d - a = 0$ to make the center line the minimum value of the '
 'function. This leads to $c = \\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}.$\n'
