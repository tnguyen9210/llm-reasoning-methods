## Step 1: Identify the direction vectors of the lines.
To find the angle between the two lines, we need to determine their direction vectors. The direction vector of the first line is (2, 3, -1) and the direction vector of the second line is (6, -1, -4).

## Step 2: Calculate the dot product of the direction vectors.
The dot product of two vectors (a, b, c) and (d, e, f) is given by ad + be + cf. Therefore, the dot product of the direction vectors is (2)(6) + (3)(-1) + (-1)(-4) = 12 - 3 + 4 = 13.

## Step 3: Calculate the magnitudes of the direction vectors.
The magnitude of a vector (a, b, c) is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. Therefore, the magnitude of the first direction vector is sqrt(2^2 + 3^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(14) and the magnitude of the second direction vector is sqrt(6^2 + (-1)^2 + (-4)^2) = sqrt(36 + 1 + 16) = sqrt(53).

## Step 4: Calculate the cosine of the angle between the lines.
The cosine of the angle between two vectors is given by the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes. Therefore, the cosine of the angle between the lines is 13 / (sqrt(14) * sqrt(53)).

## Step 5: Calculate the angle between the lines.
To find the angle between the lines, we take the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result from Step 4 and convert it to degrees.

## Step 6: Simplify the expression for the cosine of the angle between the lines.
13 / (sqrt(14) * sqrt(53)) can be simplified as 13 / (sqrt(14*53)) = 13 / (sqrt(742)) = 13 / (sqrt(2*371)) = 13 / sqrt(2*371).

## Step 7: Calculate the inverse cosine of the simplified expression.
The inverse cosine (arccos) of 13 / sqrt(2*371) can be calculated as arccos(13 / sqrt(2*371)).

## Step 8: Convert the result from Step 7 to degrees.
To convert the result from radians to degrees, we multiply it by (180 / pi).

## Step 9: Calculate the numerical value of the cosine of the angle between the lines.
13 / sqrt(2*371) = 13 / sqrt(742) = 13 / 27.038 = 0.481.

## Step 10: Calculate the numerical value of the angle between the lines in degrees.
The angle between the lines in degrees is arccos(0.481) * (180 / pi) = arccos(0.481) * 91.47.

## Step 11: Perform the final calculation.
arccos(0.481) is approximately 65.63 degrees.

## Step 12: Calculate the numerical value of the angle between the lines in degrees.
65.63 * 91.47 = 6002.78.

The final answer is: $\boxed{65.6}$
