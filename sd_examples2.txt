## Step 1:  To find the angle between two lines given by their parametric equations, we first need to identify the direction vectors of each line.
## Step 2:  The direction vector of the given line $6x = -y = -4z$ can be identified from its coefficients as $\vec{v} = \langle 6, -1, -4 \rangle$.
## Step 3:  For the first line $2x = 3y = -z$, we can identify its direction vector as $\vec{w} = \langle 2, \frac{1}{3}, -1 \rangle$.
## Step 4:  To calculate the angle between these two lines, we can use the dot product formula for vectors, which is $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = |\vec{a}| |\vec{b}| \cos \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors.
## Step 5:  The magnitude of $\vec{v}$ is given by $|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{6^2 + (-1)^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 1 + 16} = \sqrt{53}$.
## Step 6:  The magnitude of $\vec{w}$ is given by $|\vec{w}| = \sqrt{2^2 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + \frac{1}{9} + 1} = \sqrt{\frac{53}{9}}$.
## Step 7:  Now, we can use the dot product formula to find the cosine of the angle between the two lines: $\cos \theta = \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w}}{|\vec{v}| |\vec{w}|} = \frac{6 \cdot 2 + (-1) \cdot (-1) + (-4) \cdot (-4)}{\sqrt{53} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{53}{9}}} = \frac{12 + 1 + 16}{\sqrt{53} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{53}{9}}} = \frac{29}{\sqrt{53} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{53}{9}}} = \frac{29}{\sqrt{\frac{53^2}{9}}} = \frac{29}{\sqrt{\frac{2809}{9}}} = \frac{29}{\sqrt{\frac{2809}{9}}} = \frac{29 \cdot \sqrt{9}}{\sqrt{2809}} = \frac{29 \cdot 3}{\sqrt{2809}} = \frac{87}{\sqrt{2809}}$.
## Step 8:  Next, we can find the angle $\theta$ by taking the inverse cosine (arccosine) of both sides: $\theta = \cos^{-1} \left( \frac{87}{\sqrt{2809}} \right)$.
## Step 9:  Evaluating this expression, we find the angle between the two lines in radians, $\theta = \cos^{-1} \left( \frac{87}{\sqrt{2809}} \right) \approx 1.264$ radians.
## Step 10:  To convert this angle from radians to degrees, we multiply by $\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}$: $\theta \approx 1.264 \cdot \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \approx 73.5^\circ$.
## Step 11:  Therefore, the angle between the lines is approximately $\boxed{73.5}$ degrees.

## Step 7:  Now, we can use the dot product formula to find the cosine of the angle between the two lines: $\cos \theta = \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w}}{|\vec{v}| |\vec{w}|} = \frac{6 \cdot 2 + (-1) \cdot (-1) + (-4) \cdot (-4)}{\sqrt{53} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{53}{9}}} = \frac{12 + 1 + 16}{\sqrt{53} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{53}{9}}} = \frac{29}{\sqrt{53} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{53}{9}}} = \frac{29}{\sqrt{\frac{53^2}{9}}} = \frac{29}{\sqrt{\frac{2809}{9}}} = \frac{29}{\sqrt{\frac{2809}{9}}} = \frac{29 \cdot \sqrt{9}}{\sqrt{2809}} = \frac{29 \cdot 3}{\sqrt{2809}} = \frac{87}{\sqrt{2809}}$.
## Step 8:  Next, we can find the angle $\theta$ by taking the inverse cosine (arccosine) of both sides: $\theta = \cos^{-1} \left( \frac{87}{\sqrt{2809}} \right)$.
## Step 9:  Evaluating this expression, we find the angle between the two lines in radians, $\theta = \cos^{-1} \left( \frac{87}{\sqrt{2809}} \right) \approx 1.264$ radians.

## Step 11:  Therefore, the angle between the lines is approximately $\boxed{73.5}$ degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{73.5}$
