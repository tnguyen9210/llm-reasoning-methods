We know that the general form of a sine function with a positive constant $a$ is $\\sin bx + d$. The minimum value occurs when the argument of the sine function, $bx+c$, equals to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Hence the minimum value below the line $y=1$ is when the argument of the sine function is $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ or $\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$.\n",

      "## Step 5\n",
      "To find $c$, we need to set $bx+c = -\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, since we have determined that $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ is the minimum for our sine wave.\n",
      "\n",

      "## Step 8\n",
      "Since $b$ is positive, to minimize $c$, we want to maximize the negative of $bx$. Therefore, we want $bx$ to be as big as possible while still being less than zero.\n",

      "## Step 9\n",
      "To minimize $c$, we want to minimize $bx$. Since $b$ is a positive constant, the smallest value of $bx$ is when $x$ is the smallest possible value of the sine function, and that is when $x=-\\frac{\\pi}{2b}$.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 10\n",
      "Plugging in the value of $x=-\\frac{\\pi}{2b}$ into the equation $c = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} - bx$, we get $c = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} - b(-\\frac{\\pi}{2b})$.\n",

      "Plugging in $b=1$ into the equation $c = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} - b(-\\frac{\\pi}{2b})$, we get $c = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} - (-\\pi)$.\n",

      "## Step 13\n",
      "Simplifying the equation $c = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} - (-\\pi)$, we get $c = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\pi$, which further simplifies to $c = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n",
