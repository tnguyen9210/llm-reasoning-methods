## Step 1: To find the angle between the two lines, we first need to determine the direction vectors of each line.
The direction vector of the first line is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 2x = 3y = -z. This can be represented as (2, 3, -1).

## Step 2: Similarly, the direction vector of the second line is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 6x = -y = -4z. This can be represented as (6, -1, -4).

## Step 3: We can calculate the dot product of the two direction vectors using the formula (a1, b1, c1) . (a2, b2, c2) = a1*a2 + b1*b2 + c1*c2. Substituting the values, we get (2, 3, -1) . (6, -1, -4) = 2*6 + 3*(-1) + (-1)*(-4) = 12 - 3 + 4 = 13.

## Step 4: To find the magnitude of each direction vector, we use the formula sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). For the first direction vector, the magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + 3^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(14). For the second direction vector, the magnitude is sqrt(6^2 + (-1)^2 + (-4)^2) = sqrt(36 + 1 + 16) = sqrt(53).

## Step 5: Now, we can use the formula for finding the angle between two vectors: cos(θ) = (a · b) / (|a| |b|), where θ is the angle between the vectors, a and b are the direction vectors, and |a| and |b| are the magnitudes of the vectors. Substituting the calculated values, we get cos(θ) = 13 / (sqrt(14) * sqrt(53)).

## Step 6: To find the angle θ, we take the inverse cosine (arccos) of both sides. This gives us θ = arccos(13 / (sqrt(14) * sqrt(53))).

## Step 7: Simplifying the expression inside the arccos, we get θ = arccos(13 / sqrt(742)).

## Step 8: Now we calculate the arccos: arccos(13 / sqrt(742)) ≈ arccos(13 / 26.92) ≈ arccos(0.483) ≈ 64.04°

The final answer is: $\boxed{64.04}$

## Step 1: To find the angle between the two lines, we first need to determine the direction vectors of each line.
The direction vector of the first line is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 2x = 3y = -z. This can be represented as (2, 3, -1).

## Step 2: Similarly, the direction vector of the second line is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 6x = -y = -4z. This can be represented as (6, -1, -4).

## Step 3: Now, we can use the formula for finding the angle between two vectors: $\cos{\theta} = \frac{\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}}{|\vec{a}| |\vec{b}|}$, where $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ are the direction vectors of the two lines.

## Step 4: Substituting the direction vectors into the formula, we get $\cos{\theta} = \frac{(2, 3, -1) \cdot (6, -1, -4)}{(2, 3, -1) \cdot (6, -1, -4)}$.

## Step 5: Evaluating the dot product, we have $\cos{\theta} = \frac{12 - 3 + 4}{12 + 3 + 4} = \frac{13}{19}$.

## Step 6: Next, we need to find the magnitudes of the direction vectors. The magnitude of a vector $\vec{a} = (a_1, a_2, a_3)$ is given by $|\vec{a}| = \sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2}$.

## Step 7: For the direction vector (2, 3, -1), the magnitude is $|\vec{a}| = \sqrt{2^2 + 3^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{14}$.

## Step 8: For the direction vector (6, -1, -4), the magnitude is $|\vec{b}| = \sqrt{6^2 + (-1)^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 1 + 16} = \sqrt{53}$.

## Step 9: Now, we can substitute these values into the formula for $\cos{\theta}$: $\cos{\theta} = \frac{\frac{13}{19}}{\sqrt{14} \sqrt{53}}$.

## Step 10: Simplifying, we get $\cos{\theta} = \frac{13}{19} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{14} \sqrt{53}}$.

## Step 11: Further simplifying, we have $\cos{\theta} = \frac{13}{19} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{14 \cdot 53}}$.

## Step 12: $\cos{\theta} = \frac{13}{19} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{742}}$.

## Step 13: $\cos{\theta} = \frac{13}{19} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{742}}{\sqrt{742}}$.

## Step 14: $\cos{\theta} = \frac{13\sqrt{742}}{19\sqrt{742}}$.

## Step 15: The square roots can be canceled out, leaving $\cos{\theta} = \frac{13}{19}$.

## Step 16: Since this is a unit vector, the angle between the two lines is $\theta = \cos^{-1}(\frac{13}{19})$.

## Step 17: Calculating $\cos^{-1}(\frac{13}{19})$ gives us the angle in radians.

## Step 18: $\cos^{-1}(\frac{13}{19})$ is approximately 0.842068.

## Step 19: Converting this angle from radians to degrees, we have $\theta \approx 0.842068 \cdot \frac{180}{\pi}$.

## Step 20: $\theta \approx 48.23$ degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48.23}$

agg_scores = 0.708984375
## Step 1: To find the angle between the two lines, we first need to determine the direction vectors of each line.
The direction vector of the first line is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 2x = 3y = -z. This can be represented as (2, 3, -1).

## Step 2: Similarly, the direction vector of the second line can be found from the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 6x = -y = -4z.
This direction vector can be represented as (6, -1, -4).

## Step 3: The angle between two vectors can be found using the dot product formula: $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = |\mathbf{u}| |\mathbf{v}| \cos \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors.
Let $\mathbf{u} = (2, 3, -1)$ and $\mathbf{v} = (6, -1, -4)$.

## Step 4: Compute the dot product of vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$: $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = (2)(6) + (3)(-1) + (-1)(-4) = 12 - 3 + 4 = 13$.

## Step 5: The magnitudes of vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are calculated as follows:
Magnitude of $\mathbf{u}$, $|\mathbf{u}| = \sqrt{2^2 + 3^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{14}$,
Magnitude of $\mathbf{v}$, $|\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{6^2 + (-1)^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 1 + 16} = \sqrt{53}$.

## Step 6: Now, we can use the dot product formula to solve for $\theta$: $\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{|\mathbf{u}| |\mathbf{v}|} = \frac{13}{\sqrt{14} \sqrt{53}} = \frac{13}{\sqrt{14 \cdot 53}} = \frac{13}{\sqrt{742}}$.

## Step 7: To find $\theta$, we take the inverse cosine (arccos) of both sides: $\theta = \arccos \left( \frac{13}{\sqrt{742}} \right)$. We will use a calculator to find $\arccos \left( \frac{13}{\sqrt{742}} \right)$. 

## Step 8: Using a calculator to find $\theta$, we get $\theta \approx \arccos \left( \frac{13}{\sqrt{742}} \right) \approx \arccos(0.6865) \approx 46.5676^\circ$. Rounded to two decimal places, $\theta \approx 46.57^\circ$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{46.57}$

agg_scores = 0.303955078125
## Step 1: To find the angle between the two lines, we first need to determine the direction vectors of each line.
The direction vector of the first line is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 2x = 3y = -z. This can be represented as (2, 3, -1).

## Step 2: Next, we find the direction vector of the second line by considering the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 6x = -y = -4z.
The direction vector of the second line can be represented as (6, -1, -4).

## Step 3: To find the angle between the two lines, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the direction vectors.
The formula for the angle theta between two vectors u and v is given by:

cos(theta) = (u · v) / (|u| * |v|)

where u · v is the dot product of the vectors, and |u| and |v| are the magnitudes of the vectors.

## Step 4: First, we calculate the dot product of the direction vectors.
The dot product of (2, 3, -1) and (6, -1, -4) is:

(2 * 6) + (3 * -1) + (-1 * -4) = 12 - 3 + 4 = 13

## Step 5: Next, we calculate the magnitudes of the direction vectors.
The magnitude of (2, 3, -1) is given by:

√(2^2 + 3^2 + (-1)^2) = √(4 + 9 + 1) = √14

The magnitude of (6, -1, -4) is given by:

√(6^2 + (-1)^2 + (-4)^2) = √(36 + 1 + 16) = √53

## Step 6: Now, we can plug these values into the formula for cos(theta).

cos(theta) = (13) / ((√14) * (√53)) = 13 / (√(14*53)) = 13 / (√742)

## Step 7: Simplify the denominator.

cos(theta) = 13 / (√742) = 13 / (√(2*373)) = 13 / (√2 * √373)

## Step 8: Since the exact values of the square root of 742 cannot be simplified into whole numbers, we should instead look at the ratio of the given numbers without simplification.

## Step 9: The ratio of the two sides can be found by taking the square root of 742. For simplification purposes let's call that sqrt(742).

## Step 10: Then we will use the cosine of the angle in the following formula cos(theta) = (13 / sqrt(742)) / (sqrt(14) * sqrt(53)).

## Step 11: Simplify the denominator to get:

cos(theta) = (13 / sqrt(742)) / (sqrt(742) / sqrt(53)).

## Step 12: The denominator cancels out when this is simplified:


## Step 13: Simplify the equation to get:

cos(theta) = 13 / sqrt(53)


## Step 14: To find the angle, take the inverse cosine (arccos) of both sides:


## Step 15: arccos(13 / sqrt(53)) = theta


## Step 16: Calculate the numerical value of theta using a calculator or arccos function from a mathematical software or app and round it to two decimal places.


## Step 17: Using a calculator, arccos(13 / sqrt(53)) gives us an angle in radians. To convert it to degrees, multiply by (180 / pi).


## Step 18: arccos(13 / sqrt(53)) radians is approximately 61.77 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{61.77}$

agg_scores = 0.43408203125
## Step 1: Understand the problem
We need to find the angle between two lines given by their respective equations in vector form.

## Step 2: Identify the direction vectors of the lines
The direction vector of the first line is given by $\vec{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$, and the direction vector of the second line is given by $\vec{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -1 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}$. These vectors are perpendicular to each other if the dot product of $\vec{d}_1 \cdot \vec{d}_2 = 0$.

## Step 3: Check if the vectors are perpendicular
The dot product of $\vec{d}_1 \cdot \vec{d}_2$ is given by $(3)(6) + (-2)(-1) + (-1)(-4) = 18 + 2 + 4 = 24$. Since the dot product is not zero, the vectors are not perpendicular.

## Step 4: Find the cosine of the angle
Since the vectors are not perpendicular, we can find the cosine of the angle using the dot product formula: $\cos\theta = \frac{\vec{d}_1 \cdot \vec{d}_2}{\|\vec{d}_1\|\|\vec{d}_2\|}$.

## Step 5: Calculate the magnitudes of the vectors
The magnitude of $\vec{d}_1$ is given by $\|\vec{d}_1\| = \sqrt{3^2 + (-2)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 1} = \sqrt{14}$. The magnitude of $\vec{d}_2$ is given by $\|\vec{d}_2\| = \sqrt{6^2 + (-1)^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 1 + 16} = \sqrt{53}$.

## Step 6: Calculate the cosine of the angle
$\cos\theta = \frac{\vec{d}_1 \cdot \vec{d}_2}{\|\vec{d}_1\|\|\vec{d}_2\|} = \frac{24}{\sqrt{14}\sqrt{53}} = \frac{24}{\sqrt{14 \times 53}} = \frac{24}{\sqrt{942}}$.

## Step 7: Simplify the fraction
$\cos\theta = \frac{24}{\sqrt{942}} = \frac{24}{3\sqrt{141}} = \frac{8}{\sqrt{141}}$.

## Step 8: Rationalize the denominator
$\cos\theta = \frac{8}{\sqrt{141}} = \frac{8}{\sqrt{141}} \times \frac{\sqrt{141}}{\sqrt{141}} = \frac{8\sqrt{141}}{141}$.

## Step 9: Use the inverse cosine function to find the angle
$\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{8\sqrt{141}}{141}\right)$.

## Step 10: Calculate the angle
Using a calculator to find the inverse cosine of $\frac{8\sqrt{141}}{141}$ gives an angle of approximately $26.61^\circ$.

## Step 11: Express the angle in terms of a unique acute angle
$\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{8\sqrt{141}}{141}\right)$, but the angle should be expressed in degrees which means the answer to that part of the question is simply this value which is $26.61^\circ$

agg_scores = 0.935546875
## Step 1: Understand the problem
We need to find the angle between two lines given by their respective equations in vector form.

## Step 2: Identify the direction vectors of the lines
The direction vector of the first line can be identified from the coefficients of x, y, and z in its equation, which are (2, 3, -1). The direction vector of the second line is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z in its equation, which are (6, 1, -4).

## Step 3: Calculate the dot product of the direction vectors
The dot product of two vectors (a, b, c) and (d, e, f) is given by the equation a*d + b*e + c*f.
So, for the first line the dot product is (2*6) + (3*1) + (-1*(-4)) = 12 + 3 + 4 = 19.
For the second line the dot product is (6*6) + (1*1) + (-4*(-4)) = 36 + 1 + 16 = 53.

## Step 4: Calculate the magnitudes of the direction vectors
The magnitude of a vector (a, b, c) is given by the equation sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2).
For the first line, the magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + 3^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(14).
For the second line, the magnitude is sqrt(6^2 + 1^2 + (-4)^2) = sqrt(36 + 1 + 16) = sqrt(53).

## Step 5: Calculate the cosine of the angle between the lines using the dot product and the magnitudes
The formula for the cosine of the angle (θ) between two vectors u and v is given by the equation cos(θ) = (u · v) / (|u| |v|).
So, cos(θ) = (19 / (sqrt(14) * sqrt(53))) = (19 / sqrt(14*53)) = (19 / sqrt(742)).

## Step 6: Calculate the angle between the lines
The angle between the two lines can be calculated using the inverse cosine (arccos) function.
θ = arccos((19 / sqrt(742))).

## Step 7: Evaluate the arccos function
Using a calculator, we can evaluate the arccos function to obtain the angle in radians. θ ≈ arccos((19 / sqrt(742))) ≈ 0.855 radians.

## Step 8: Convert the angle to degrees
Since the angle in radians is already in the correct range, no further conversion is needed. θ ≈ 0.855 * (180 / π) ≈ 49.5 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{49.5}$

agg_scores = 0.63720703125
## Step 1: Understand the problem
We need to find the angle between two lines given by their respective equations in vector form.

## Step 2: Find direction vectors for both lines
For the first line $2x = 3y = -z$, the direction vector is $\vec{v}_1 = \langle 2, 3, -1 \rangle$ since all components of the vector are proportional to the coefficients of the respective variables.

For the second line $6x = -y = -4z$, the direction vector is $\vec{v}_2 = \langle 6, 1, 4 \rangle$ since all components of the vector are proportional to the coefficients of the respective variables.

## Step 3: Calculate the dot product of the direction vectors
The dot product $\vec{v}_1 \cdot \vec{v}_2 = (2)(6) + (3)(1) + (-1)(4) = 12 + 3 - 4 = 11$.

## Step 4: Calculate the magnitude of each direction vector
The magnitude of $\vec{v}_1$ is $\|\vec{v}_1\| = \sqrt{2^2 + 3^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{14}$.

The magnitude of $\vec{v}_2$ is $\|\vec{v}_2\| = \sqrt{6^2 + 1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{36 + 1 + 16} = \sqrt{53}$.

## Step 5: Apply the formula for finding the angle between two vectors
We use the formula $\cos{\theta} = \frac{\vec{v}_1 \cdot \vec{v}_2}{\|\vec{v}_1\|\|\vec{v}_2\|}$. So, $\cos{\theta} = \frac{11}{\sqrt{14}\sqrt{53}}$.

## Step 6: Solve for the angle $\theta$
$\theta = \cos^{-1}{\left(\frac{11}{\sqrt{14}\sqrt{53}}\right)}$.

## Step 7: Simplify and calculate the angle in degrees
Simplifying gives us $\theta = \cos^{-1}{\left(\frac{11}{\sqrt{14}\sqrt{53}}\right)} \approx \cos^{-1}{(0.73156)} \approx 47.596$ degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{47.6}$

agg_scores = 0.763671875
## Step 1: Understand the problem
We need to find the angle between two lines given by their respective equations in vector form.

## Step 2: Convert equations to vector form
For the first line: $2x = 3y = -z$, we can express $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of one parameter $t$ as $x = 3t$, $y = t$, and $z = -2t$. So the vector equation of the first line is $\vec{r} = \vec{i} \cdot (3t) + \vec{j} \cdot t + \vec{k} \cdot (-2t)$.

## Step 3: Convert equation to vector form for the second line
For the second line: $6x = -y = -4z$, we can express $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of one parameter $s$ as $x = \frac{1}{2}s$, $y = -1$, and $z = s$. So the vector equation of the second line is $\vec{r} = \vec{i} \cdot \frac{1}{2}s - \vec{j} - \vec{k} \cdot s$.

## Step 4: Find the direction vectors of the lines
From the vector equations, the direction vectors of the lines are $\vec{v_1} = \vec{i} + \vec{j} - \vec{k}$ and $\vec{v_2} = \vec{i} - \vec{j} - \vec{k}$.

## Step 5: Calculate the dot product of the direction vectors
The dot product of the two direction vectors is $\vec{v_1} \cdot \vec{v_2} = (\vec{i} + \vec{j} - \vec{k}) \cdot (\vec{i} - \vec{j} - \vec{k}) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$.

## Step 6: Calculate the magnitudes of the direction vectors
The magnitudes of the direction vectors are $|\vec{v_1}| = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{3}$ and $|\vec{v_2}| = \sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{3}$.

## Step 7: Use the dot product formula to find the angle between the lines
The formula to find the angle between two vectors $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ is $\cos{\theta} = \frac{\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}}{|\vec{a}| |\vec{b}|}$. Substituting the magnitudes and dot product of the direction vectors, we get $\cos{\theta} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{3} \sqrt{3}} = \frac{3}{3} = 1$.

## Step 8: Find the angle in degrees
Since $\cos{\theta} = 1$, the angle $\theta$ is $0$ degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$

## Step 1:  The problem provides a graph representing the function $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d.$ We are tasked with finding the smallest possible value of the constant $c$ in this function.
## Step 2:  Since $c$ is the phase shift of the sine function, it indicates how the graph of the sine function is shifted left or right. In this case, the graph is shifted to the left by $-\frac{\pi}{3}$.
## Step 3:  Therefore, to find the smallest possible value of $c$, we need to consider the vertical shift of the graph.
## Step 4:  As the function is of the form $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$, the vertical shift is given by the constant term $d$. In this case, we are looking for the smallest absolute value of the vertical shift, which occurs when the graph is centered vertically at its highest point.
## Step 5:  Since the maximum value of the function is $3$ and the minimum value is $-1$, the vertical shift should be such that the graph reaches its maximum and minimum values at the same point.
## Step 6:  To ensure that the graph is centered vertically at its highest point, the vertical shift $d$ must be equal to the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the function.
## Step 7:  This results in the equation $d = 3 - (-1) = 4$. Therefore, the smallest possible value of $c$ is $\frac{\pi}{3}$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{\pi}{3}}$

## Step 1
First,  recall that the general form of a sine function is $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d.$ To understand how the graph of this function behaves, we need to break it down into its components. The graph consists of three sine waves moving in a certain pattern. Each sine wave has a period of $2\pi$ since they all complete a full cycle over this interval.

## Step 2
The graph of $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$ is made up of three sine waves that have a period of $2\pi.$  Since the period is the distance between consecutive points on the graph and is independent of the amplitude, the period of the graph is $2\pi.$  Because the graph covers all values between $-3$ and $3$ over the interval of $0$ to $2\pi,$ the smallest positive value for c is $-\frac{\pi}{3}$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-\frac{\pi}{3}}$

## Step 1
First,  recall that the general form of a sine function is $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d.$ To understand how the graph of this function behaves, we need to break it down into its components. The graph consists of three sine waves moving in a certain pattern. Each sine wave has a period of $2\pi$ since they all complete a full cycle over this interval.

## Step 2
Since the period of the function is $2\pi,$ we can determine that the graph of $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$ covers one full cycle in the interval $[0,\pi]$ (and also in $[2\pi,3\pi]$). To do this, we need to find the values of $a,b,c,$ and $d$ that will make this happen.

## Step 3
With the equation $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d,$ the amplitude of the graph is $a$, which is the maximum and minimum values of the function. The period of the function is $2\pi$, so we know that the graph will have the same amplitude in each $2\pi$ interval.

## Step 4
Since the graph completes one full cycle in $[0,\pi]$ and also in $[2\pi,3\pi]$, we know that the amplitude of the graph must be $a = 3/2$. To verify this, we can also check that the maximum value of the function is $3/2$ in the interval $[0,\pi]$ and also in $[2\pi,3\pi]$.

## Step 5
Since we have determined that the amplitude of the graph is $a = 3/2$, we can say that the graph of $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$ will be completely contained in the interval $[-3/2,3/2]$.

## Step 6
The graph of $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$ will have its minimum and maximum values in this interval. Since we want to find the smallest value of $c$ for which the graph will be entirely contained in the interval $[-3/2,3/2]$, we are looking for the smallest $c$ such that the function is shifted to the left so that its minimum is $-3/2$.

## Step 7
We know that the general form of a sine function is $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$. To shift the graph to the left by $c$ units, we need to adjust the linear component of the equation accordingly. Therefore, we need to find the smallest $c$ such that $c + b\pi = 0$. Since $b$ is a positive constant, we can set $b = 1$.

## Step 8
Now that we know $b = 1$, we can find the smallest $c$ for which the function will be shifted to the left by $c$ units. We have the equation $c + b\pi = 0$. Substituting $b = 1$, we get $c + \pi = 0$. Solving this equation for $c$, we obtain $c = -\pi$.

## Step 9
Therefore, the smallest possible value of $c$ for which the graph of $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$ will be entirely contained in the interval $[-3/2,3/2]$ is $-\pi$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-\pi}$

## Step 1
First,  recall that the general form of a sine function is $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d.$ To understand how the graph of this function behaves, we need to break it down into its components. The graph consists of three sine waves moving in a certain pattern. Each sine wave has a period of $2\pi$ since they all complete a full cycle over this interval.

## Step 2
Looking at the graph, we can see that it consists of three sine waves rotating in the opposite direction, so there isn't a single period. To analyze the graph further, we need to observe its components more closely and how they interact with each other.

## Step 3
On the $x$-axis, the graph is the same for all three sine waves. Since the period of the graph is $2\pi$, each sine wave will complete one full cycle over this interval. This implies that the graph of this function completes one full cycle over the interval of $2\pi/3$.

## Step 4
The graph is symmetric about $\frac{\pi}{2}$ because the graph is always the same for the three sine waves. For every point $(x, y)$ on the graph, there must be a corresponding point $(x+\pi/2, y)$ on the graph.

## Step 5
This symmetry means that for every point $(x, y)$ on the graph, there is a corresponding point $(x+\pi/2, y)$ on the graph. So, the graph is symmetric about $\frac{3\pi}{4}$. In order to have symmetry about $\frac{3\pi}{4}$, the graph must be shifted $\frac{\pi}{4}$ to the right.

## Step 6
The graph is shifted to the right by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ which is the same as adding $\frac{\pi}{4}$ to the x coordinate, for that is what we do when we shift everything to the right.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{\pi}{4}}$

## Step 1
First,  recall that the general form of a sine function is $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d.$ To understand how the graph of this function behaves, we need to break it down into its components. The graph consists of three sine waves moving in a certain pattern. Each sine wave has a period of $2\pi$ since they all complete a full cycle over this interval.

## Step 2
To find the smallest possible value of $c$, we need to consider the graph of the function given in the problem statement.  The graph has peaks at $y = 2$ and troughs at $y = -1$.  Since it has a period of $\frac{2 \pi}{3}$ and completes one full cycle over this interval, we can use this information to find the smallest possible value of $c$.


## Step 3
The general form for the sine function can be further divided into two sine functions, with the first one having a phase shift of $\frac{c}{b}$. To minimize the phase shift, we need to minimize the value of $c$.

## Step 4
Since the period of the function is $\frac{2 \pi}{3}$, we know that one full cycle of the function occurs over this interval.  This means that the period is equal to $\frac{2\pi}{b}$. Therefore, $\frac{2\pi}{b} = \frac{2\pi}{3}$ and $b = 3$.

## Step 5
Since the period is $\frac{2 \pi}{b}$ and the period is equal to $\frac{2\pi}{b}$, we have $\frac{2\pi}{b} = \frac{2\pi}{3}$. This is a true statement for any positive value of $b$.

## Step 6
In order to minimize the phase shift, we need to minimize the value of $c$. To do this, the closest we can get to the midline is to set the phase shift equal to the minimum of the local maxima and minima of the function.

## Step 7
The local maxima and minima of the function are at $y = 2$ and $y = -1$, respectively.  Since the middle value of $y$ is $0$, the minimum of the local maxima and minima is $0$.  Therefore, we can set $\frac{c}{b} = 0$.

## Step 8
Since $b = 3$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $\frac{c}{3} = 0$.

## Step 9
Solving for $c$, we find that $c = 0$.

## Step 10
Therefore, the smallest possible value of $c$ is $\boxed{0}$.
