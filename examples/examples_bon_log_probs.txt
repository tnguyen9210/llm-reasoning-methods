## Step 1: To find the angle between the two lines, we first need to determine the direction vectors of each line.
The direction vector of the first line is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 2x = 3y = -z. This can be represented as (2, 3, -1).

## Step 2: Similarly, the direction vector of the second line is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 6x = -y = -4z. This can be represented as (6, -1, -4).

## Step 3: We can calculate the dot product of the two direction vectors using the formula (a1, b1, c1) . (a2, b2, c2) = a1*a2 + b1*b2 + c1*c2. Substituting the values, we get (2, 3, -1) . (6, -1, -4) = 2*6 + 3*(-1) + (-1)*(-4) = 12 - 3 + 4 = 13.

## Step 4: To find the magnitude of each direction vector, we use the formula sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). For the first direction vector, the magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + 3^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(14). For the second direction vector, the magnitude is sqrt(6^2 + (-1)^2 + (-4)^2) = sqrt(36 + 1 + 16) = sqrt(53).

## Step 5: Now, we can use the formula for finding the angle between two vectors: cos(θ) = (a · b) / (|a| |b|), where θ is the angle between the vectors, a and b are the direction vectors, and |a| and |b| are the magnitudes of the vectors. Substituting the calculated values, we get cos(θ) = 13 / (sqrt(14) * sqrt(53)).

## Step 6: To find the angle θ, we take the inverse cosine (arccos) of both sides. This gives us θ = arccos(13 / (sqrt(14) * sqrt(53))).

## Step 7: Simplifying the expression inside the arccos, we get θ = arccos(13 / sqrt(742)).

## Step 8: Now we calculate the arccos: arccos(13 / sqrt(742)) ≈ arccos(13 / 26.92) ≈ arccos(0.483) ≈ 64.04°

The final answer is: $\boxed{64.04}$

## Step 1: To find the angle between the two lines, we first need to determine the direction vectors of each line.
The direction vector of the first line is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 2x = 3y = -z. This can be represented as (2, 3, -1).

## Step 2: Similarly, the direction vector of the second line is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 6x = -y = -4z. This can be represented as (6, -1, -4).

## Step 3: Now, we can use the formula for finding the angle between two vectors: $\cos{\theta} = \frac{\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}}{|\vec{a}| |\vec{b}|}$, where $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ are the direction vectors of the two lines.

## Step 4: Substituting the direction vectors into the formula, we get $\cos{\theta} = \frac{(2, 3, -1) \cdot (6, -1, -4)}{(2, 3, -1) \cdot (6, -1, -4)}$.

## Step 5: Evaluating the dot product, we have $\cos{\theta} = \frac{12 - 3 + 4}{12 + 3 + 4} = \frac{13}{19}$.

## Step 6: Next, we need to find the magnitudes of the direction vectors. The magnitude of a vector $\vec{a} = (a_1, a_2, a_3)$ is given by $|\vec{a}| = \sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2}$.

## Step 7: For the direction vector (2, 3, -1), the magnitude is $|\vec{a}| = \sqrt{2^2 + 3^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{14}$.

## Step 8: For the direction vector (6, -1, -4), the magnitude is $|\vec{b}| = \sqrt{6^2 + (-1)^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 1 + 16} = \sqrt{53}$.

## Step 9: Now, we can substitute these values into the formula for $\cos{\theta}$: $\cos{\theta} = \frac{\frac{13}{19}}{\sqrt{14} \sqrt{53}}$.

## Step 10: Simplifying, we get $\cos{\theta} = \frac{13}{19} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{14} \sqrt{53}}$.

## Step 11: Further simplifying, we have $\cos{\theta} = \frac{13}{19} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{14 \cdot 53}}$.

## Step 12: $\cos{\theta} = \frac{13}{19} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{742}}$.

## Step 13: $\cos{\theta} = \frac{13}{19} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{742}}{\sqrt{742}}$.

## Step 14: $\cos{\theta} = \frac{13\sqrt{742}}{19\sqrt{742}}$.

## Step 15: The square roots can be canceled out, leaving $\cos{\theta} = \frac{13}{19}$.

## Step 16: Since this is a unit vector, the angle between the two lines is $\theta = \cos^{-1}(\frac{13}{19})$.

## Step 17: Calculating $\cos^{-1}(\frac{13}{19})$ gives us the angle in radians.

## Step 18: $\cos^{-1}(\frac{13}{19})$ is approximately 0.842068.

## Step 19: Converting this angle from radians to degrees, we have $\theta \approx 0.842068 \cdot \frac{180}{\pi}$.

## Step 20: $\theta \approx 48.23$ degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48.23}$

## Step 1: To find the angle between the two lines, we first need to determine the direction vectors of each line.
The direction vector of the first line is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 2x = 3y = -z. This can be represented as (2, 3, -1).

## Step 2: Similarly, the direction vector of the second line can be found from the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 6x = -y = -4z.
This direction vector can be represented as (6, -1, -4).

## Step 3: The angle between two vectors can be found using the dot product formula: $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = |\mathbf{u}| |\mathbf{v}| \cos \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors.
Let $\mathbf{u} = (2, 3, -1)$ and $\mathbf{v} = (6, -1, -4)$.

## Step 4: Compute the dot product of vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$: $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = (2)(6) + (3)(-1) + (-1)(-4) = 12 - 3 + 4 = 13$.

## Step 5: The magnitudes of vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are calculated as follows:
Magnitude of $\mathbf{u}$, $|\mathbf{u}| = \sqrt{2^2 + 3^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{14}$,
Magnitude of $\mathbf{v}$, $|\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{6^2 + (-1)^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 1 + 16} = \sqrt{53}$.

## Step 6: Now, we can use the dot product formula to solve for $\theta$: $\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{|\mathbf{u}| |\mathbf{v}|} = \frac{13}{\sqrt{14} \sqrt{53}} = \frac{13}{\sqrt{14 \cdot 53}} = \frac{13}{\sqrt{742}}$.

## Step 7: To find $\theta$, we take the inverse cosine (arccos) of both sides: $\theta = \arccos \left( \frac{13}{\sqrt{742}} \right)$. We will use a calculator to find $\arccos \left( \frac{13}{\sqrt{742}} \right)$. 

## Step 8: Using a calculator to find $\theta$, we get $\theta \approx \arccos \left( \frac{13}{\sqrt{742}} \right) \approx \arccos(0.6865) \approx 46.5676^\circ$. Rounded to two decimal places, $\theta \approx 46.57^\circ$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{46.57}$
