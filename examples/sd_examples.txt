## Step 1:  To find the smallest possible value of $c$ in the equation $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$, we need to understand the general form of the sine function and how its phase shift affects the graph.
## Step 2:  The given graph indicates that the function $y = 2 \sin (3x + \pi) + 1$ represents a sine function with amplitude $2$, period $\frac{2\pi}{3}$, and vertical shift $1$ unit above the x-axis.
## Step 3:  From the graph, we can observe that the maximum value of the function is $3$ (at $x = -\frac{\pi}{6}$) and the minimum value is $-1$ (at $x = \frac{\pi}{6}$), indicating that the smallest value the function can attain is $-1$.
## Step 4:  For a sine function, the phase shift is given by $\frac{c}{b}$, where $b$ is the coefficient of $x$ inside the sine function. Therefore, we need to find the smallest value of $c$ that corresponds to the graph having its minimum at $y = -1$.
## Step 5:  Since the graph oscillates between $-1$ and $3$, the phase shift $c$ should be such that the graph starts at the minimum point. This occurs when the sine function is shifted to start at $y = -1$.
## Step 6:  To achieve this, we need to move the graph to start at $y = -1$ relative to the standard position, corresponding to the phase shift $\frac{c}{b}$.
## Step 7:  Since the maximum point of the graph is at $\left( -\frac{\pi}{6}, \  -1 \right)$, we can calculate the phase shift by finding the difference between the maximum point and the origin, and then dividing it by the amplitude of the function.
## Step 8:  This gives us $\frac{c}{3} = -\frac{\pi}{6}$, from which we can solve for $c$ to find the smallest possible value.
## Step 9:  Therefore, $c = -\frac{\pi}{6} \cdot 3 = -\frac{\pi}{2}$. This is the smallest possible value of $c$ that corresponds to the graph having its minimum at $y = -1$.
## Step 10:  Hence, the smallest possible value of $c$ is $\boxed{-\frac{\pi}{2}}$.
