## Step 1: Identify the direction vectors of the lines
To find the angle between the lines, we first need to identify their direction vectors. The direction vector of the first line is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 2x = 3y = -z. This vector is (2, 3, -1). The direction vector of the second line is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 6x = -y = -4z. This vector is (6, -1, -4).

## Step 2: Find the dot product of the direction vectors
The dot product of two vectors (a, b, c) and (d, e, f) is given by ad + be + cf. We will use this formula to find the dot product of the direction vectors. The dot product of (2, 3, -1) and (6, -1, -4) is 2(6) + 3(-1) + (-1)(-4) = 12 - 3 + 4 = 13.

## Step 3: Find the magnitudes of the direction vectors
To find the magnitude of a vector (a, b, c), we use the formula sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). We will find the magnitudes of the direction vectors. The magnitude of (2, 3, -1) is sqrt(2^2 + 3^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(14). The magnitude of (6, -1, -4) is sqrt(6^2 + (-1)^2 + (-4)^2) = sqrt(36 + 1 + 16) = sqrt(53).

## Step 4: Calculate the cosine of the angle between the lines
The formula for the cosine of the angle between two vectors (a, b, c) and (d, e, f) is given by the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes: cos(theta) = (a*d + b*e + c*f) / (|a|*|d|*|e|*|f|).

## Step 6: Simplify the angle in degrees
To simplify the angle in degrees, we can use a calculator or the arccos function. The angle between the lines is approximately arccos(13 / sqrt(742)) = 61.03 degrees.

$\cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{481}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{481}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{481}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{481}}{\sqrt{2}}$.

## Step 12: Multiply numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{2}$
$\cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{481}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{481} \cdot \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{481 \cdot 2}}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{962}}{\sqrt{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{962}}{2}$.

## Step 13: Simplify $\sqrt{962}$
$\sqrt{962} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 241} = \sqrt{4} \cdot \sqrt{241} = 2\sqrt{241}$.

## Step 14: Substitute the simplified $\sqrt{962}$ back into the expression for $\cos \theta$
$\cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{962}}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{241}}{2}$.

## Step 15: Simplify the expression
$\cos \theta = \frac{2\sqrt{241}}{2} = \sqrt{241}$.

## Step 16: Take the inverse cosine of both sides
$\theta = \cos^{-1}(\sqrt{241})$.

## Step 17: Solve the inverse cosine
Since $\sqrt{241}$ is not a simple angle in the first quadrant, we can find its reference angle in the first quadrant, which is $(90 - \cos^{-1}(\sqrt{241}))^\circ$. However, to find the angle between the lines, we need to consider the reference angle associated with $\theta$ in the second quadrant. Since the cosine of an angle in the second quadrant can be negative, the reference angle will be the same as $\theta$ but with the same coefficient of $-1$, so we can choose the angle in the second quadrant that has the same absolute value of the cosine.

## Step 18: Since $\sqrt{241} > 1$, the angle in the second quadrant will be $\pi - \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle in the first quadrant.

The final answer is: $\boxed{99}$
