## Step 1: Identify the direction vectors of the two lines.
The direction vector of the first line is (2, 3, -1) and the direction vector of the second line is (6, -1, 4).

## Step 2: Use the dot product formula to find the cosine of the angle between the two direction vectors.
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} &= \left\lVert \mathbf{u} \right\rVert \left\lVert \mathbf{v} \right\rVert \cos{\theta} \\
\left\lVert \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \right\rVert \left\lVert \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \right\rVert \cos{\theta} &= 0 \\
\sqrt{2^2 + 3^2 + (-1)^2} \sqrt{6^2 + (-1)^2 + 4^2} \cos{\theta} &= 0 \\
\sqrt{4 + 9 + 1} \sqrt{36 + 1 + 16} \cos{\theta} &= 0 \\
\sqrt{14} \sqrt{53} \cos{\theta} &= 0 \\
\sqrt{14 \times 53} \cos{\theta} &= 0 \\
\sqrt{53} \cos{\theta} &= 0 \\
\cos{\theta} &= 0 \\
\end{align*}

## Step 3: Solve for the angle between the two lines.
Since $\cos{\theta} = 0$, then $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi$, where $k$ is a positive integer.

## Step 4: Since $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi$ must be less than $180^{\circ}$, we can use $k = 0$ to get the correct angle between the two lines. Therefore, the angle is $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60.0}$

## Step 1: Identify the direction vectors of the two lines.
The direction vector of the first line is (2, 3, -1) and the direction vector of the second line is (6, -1, 4).

## Step 2: Calculate the dot product of the two direction vectors.
The dot product of the two direction vectors is (2)(6) + (3)(-1) + (-1)(4) = 12 - 3 - 4 = 5.

## Step 3: Calculate the magnitudes of the two direction vectors.
The magnitude of the first direction vector is sqrt((2)^2 + (3)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(14).
The magnitude of the second direction vector is sqrt((6)^2 + (-1)^2 + (4)^2) = sqrt(36 + 1 + 16) = sqrt(53).

## Step 4: Use the formula for finding the angle between two vectors.
The angle between the two lines is given by the formula: cos(angle) = (dot product of the vectors) / (magnitude of vector 1 * magnitude of vector 2) = 5 / (sqrt(14) * sqrt(53)).

## Step 5: Simplify the expression for cos(angle).
First, simplify the denominator: sqrt(14) * sqrt(53) = sqrt(14*53) = sqrt(742).
cos(angle) = 5 / sqrt(742).

## Step 6: Find the angle using the inverse cosine function.
The angle is given by: angle = arccos(5 / sqrt(742)).

## Step 7: Calculate the numerical value of the angle.
We can use a calculator to find the numerical value of the angle in radians, then convert it to degrees.

Let's calculate the angle:
angle ≈ arccos(5 / sqrt(742)) ≈ 0.229 radians.

## Step 8: Convert the angle from radians to degrees.
Multiply the angle in radians by (180 / pi): angle ≈ 0.229 * (180 / pi) ≈ 13.21 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13.21}$

## Step 1: To find the angle between the two lines, we first need to determine the direction vectors of each line.
The direction vector of the first line is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 2x = 3y = -z, which is (2, 3, -1).

## Step 2: Similarly, the direction vector of the second line is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 6x = -y = -4z, which is (6, -1, -4).
## Step 3: The angle θ between two vectors u and v is given by the formula cos(θ) = (u · v) / (|u| |v|), where u · v is the dot product and |u| and |v| are the magnitudes of the vectors.
## Step 4: We can calculate the dot product of the two direction vectors: (2, 3, -1) · (6, -1, -4) = 2*6 + 3*(-1) -1*(-4) = 12 - 3 + 4 = 13.
## Step 5: Next, we need to calculate the magnitudes of the two direction vectors.
## Step 6: The magnitude of the first direction vector (2, 3, -1) is |(2, 3, -1)| = sqrt(2^2 + 3^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(14).
## Step 7: The magnitude of the second direction vector (6, -1, -4) is |(6, -1, -4)| = sqrt(6^2 + (-1)^2 + (-4)^2) = sqrt(36 + 1 + 16) = sqrt(53).
## Step 8: Now we can use the formula for the angle between two vectors using their dot product and magnitudes: cos(θ) = 13 / (sqrt(14) * sqrt(53)).
## Step 9: Simplifying the expression, we get cos(θ) = 13 / sqrt(14*53) = 13 / sqrt(738).
## Step 10: To find the angle θ, we take the inverse cosine (arccos) of both sides: θ = arccos(13 / sqrt(738)).
## Step 11: Evaluating the expression, we get θ ≈ arccos(13 / 27.491) ≈ 14.1°.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.1}$

## Step 1: To find the angle between the two lines, we first need to determine the direction vectors of each line.
The direction vector of the first line is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 2x = 3y = -z, which is (2, 3, -1).

## Step 2: The direction vector of the second line is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation 6x = -y = -4z, which is (6, -1, -4).

## Step 3: To find the angle between the two lines, we can use the dot product formula, which is given by (a · b) = |a| |b| cos(θ), where a and b are the direction vectors of the lines.

## Step 4: First, we need to find the magnitudes of the direction vectors. The magnitude of vector (a) is given by |a| = sqrt(a1^2 + a2^2 + a3^2) = sqrt(2^2 + 3^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(14).

## Step 5: Similarly, the magnitude of vector (b) is given by |b| = sqrt(6^2 + (-1)^2 + (-4)^2) = sqrt(36 + 1 + 16) = sqrt(53).

## Step 6: Now, we can plug in the values into the dot product formula: (2, 3, -1) · (6, -1, -4) = |(2, 3, -1)| |(6, -1, -4)| cos(θ) = (2)(6) + (3)(-1) + (-1)(-4) = 12 - 3 + 4 = 13.

## Step 7: Next, we can find the value of cos(θ) by dividing the dot product by the product of the magnitudes: cos(θ) = 13 / (sqrt(14) * sqrt(53)).

## Step 8: Now, we can simplify the expression for cos(θ) by rationalizing the denominator: cos(θ) = 13 / (sqrt(14) * sqrt(53)) = 13 / (sqrt(14*53)) = 13 / (sqrt(742)).

## Step 9: To find the angle θ, we can take the inverse cosine (arccos) of both sides: θ = arccos(13 / (sqrt(742))).

## Step 10: Using a calculator, we can find the value of θ in radians: θ ≈ arccos(13 / (sqrt(742))) ≈ 0.929 radians.

## Step 11: To convert the angle from radians to degrees, we can multiply by 180 / pi: θ_degrees ≈ 0.929 * (180 / pi) ≈ 53.48 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{53.48}$

## Step 1: Understand the problem
We need to find the angle between two lines given by their respective equations in 3D space.

## Step 2: Determine the direction vectors for each line
For the first line, $2x = 3y = -z$, the direction vector can be taken as $\mathbf{v}_1 = (2, 3, -1)$, obtained by solving the equations for x, y, and z.

For the second line, $6x = -y = -4z$, the direction vector can be taken as $\mathbf{v}_2 = (6, 1, 4)$, obtained by solving the equations for x, y, and z.

## Step 3: Calculate the dot product of the direction vectors
The dot product $\mathbf{v}_1 \cdot \mathbf{v}_2 = (2)(6) + (3)(1) + (-1)(4) = 12 + 3 - 4 = 11$.

## Step 4: Calculate the magnitudes of the direction vectors
The magnitude of $\mathbf{v}_1$ is $\|\mathbf{v}_1\| = \sqrt{(2)^2 + (3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{14}$.

The magnitude of $\mathbf{v}_2$ is $\|\mathbf{v}_2\| = \sqrt{(6)^2 + (1)^2 + (4)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 1 + 16} = \sqrt{53}$.

## Step 5: Calculate the cosine of the angle between the lines
The cosine of the angle between the lines is given by $\cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{v}_1 \cdot \mathbf{v}_2}{\|\mathbf{v}_1\|\|\mathbf{v}_2\|} = \frac{11}{\sqrt{14}\sqrt{53}} = \frac{11}{\sqrt{14 \cdot 53}} = \frac{11}{\sqrt{742}}$.

## Step 6: Calculate the angle in degrees
$\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{11}{\sqrt{742}}\right)$.

## Step 7: Evaluate $\arccos\left(\frac{11}{\sqrt{742}}\right)$ to get the angle in radians, then convert it to degrees.

Evaluate $\arccos\left(\frac{11}{\sqrt{742}}\right) \approx 1.195$ radians, and $\theta \approx 1.195 \times \frac{180}{\pi} \approx 68.8^\circ$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68.8}$

## Step 1:  The graph of $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$ represents a sine function with amplitude $|a|$, period $\frac{2\pi}{b}$, and vertical shift $d$. Since we're tasked with finding the smallest possible value of $c$, we need to consider the possible shifts and how they affect the graph.
## Step 2:  The general form of the given function is $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$. This indicates that the horizontal shift of the graph is represented by the value of $c$ in the expression $bx + c.$
## Step 3:  We know that the period of the sine function is $\frac{2\pi}{b}$. Therefore, the graph of the function $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$ will be shifted to the left by $-\frac{\pi}{b}$ units if $c = -\frac{\pi}{b}$ or to the right by $\frac{\pi}{b}$ units if $c = \frac{\pi}{b}.$
## Step 4:  To get the smallest possible value of $c$, we should choose the shift that results in the least vertical displacement from the midline of the sine curve. In other words, we want the shift to be as small as possible.
## Step 5:  To achieve the smallest possible vertical displacement, we need to minimize the absolute value of $c.$ This happens when the shift is as close to zero as possible while still being positive.
## Step 6:  Looking at the graph, we can see that when $c = 0$, the graph is centered vertically around the midline of the sine curve, which is $d.$ This means that the smallest possible value of $c$ is $\boxed{0}.$

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$

## Step 1
First,  recall that the general form of a sine function is $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d.$ To understand how the graph of $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$ behaves, we should consider the transformations it undergoes.

## Step 2
We know that the sine function has a phase shift $\frac{\pi}{2}$, so the graph will lie in the first or fourth quadrant.

## Step 3
To find the phase shift, we need to examine the $x$-values of the points where the graph intersects the $x$-axis. These points occur when the graph of $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$ is at the point $(0,0)$, so we have $0 = a\sin (b\cdot 0+c) + d$. The answer, by mathematical induction, is $c = \frac{\pi}{2}$.

## Step 4
We find the range of values for $c$ that satisfy the condition, which is $\frac{\pi}{2} \leq c \leq \pi$.

## Step 5
Now, we need to determine the smallest possible value of $c$ within the range $\left[\frac{\pi}{2},\pi \right)$.

## Step 6
The smallest possible value of $c$ can be found by choosing the smallest value from the range $\left[\frac{\pi}{2},\pi \right)$.

## Step 7
Since the value of $c$ cannot be $\frac{\pi}{2}$, the smallest possible value of $c$ is the only other value in the range $\left[\frac{\pi}{2},\pi \right)$.

## Step 8
Therefore, the smallest possible value of $c$ is $\frac{\pi}{2}$.

## Step 9
However, the correct answer is the smaller value within the defined range. So the correct smallest possible value of $c$ is $\frac{\pi}{2}$.

agg_scores = 0.044677734375
## Step 1
First,  recall that the general form of a sine function is $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d.$ To understand how the graph of $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$ behaves, we should consider the transformations it undergoes.

## Step 2
When a sine function is shifted in the x-direction by $c$ units, it becomes $y = a \sin (bx + (c - b)x) + d.$ This means that the graph of $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$ has the same shape and amplitude as the graph of $y = a \sin (bx) + d,$ but it has been shifted $c$ units to the left.

## Step 3
The graph also has the same period and frequency as the graph of $y = a \sin (bx) + d$. This is because the original $\sin$ function has a period of $2 \pi,$ and the transformations do not change this property.

## Step 4
Now we need to examine the graph of $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$ and find the range of values for $c$ such that the graph shifts to the right by at least one unit to be visible in the graph.

## Step 5
To find the smallest possible value of $c$, we note that the graph will shift to the right by at least one unit if the period of the graph is greater than one unit, since a graph that has a period of less than one unit will have its center shifted to the right. This implies that we need $2 \pi = 2 \pi k + 2 \pi$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer.

## Step 6
Solving the equation $2 \pi = 2 \pi k + 2 \pi$ for $k$, we find that $k = 1$. Therefore, the smallest possible value of $c$ for which the graph of $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$ will be visible in the graph is $\boxed{2 \pi - 2 \pi=0}$

## Step 1:  First, we need to understand the given problem, which involves finding the smallest possible value of $c$ in the function $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d.$
## Step 2:  To approach this problem, we must analyze the graph of the sine function. The graph oscillates between the values of $1$ and $-1.$
## Step 3:  Since the function consists of a sine wave, the phase shift is critical in determining the graph's position and orientation. The phase shift is given by $c.$
## Step 4:  The smallest possible value of $c$ will result in the graph starting at the highest point of the oscillation, which is $1.$
## Step 5:  To find the starting point of the graph, we note that the function needs to reach its maximum value of $a.$
## Step 6:  Based on the graph, the starting point of the graph is $3.$
## Step 7:  The distance from the starting point to the initial maximum value of the function is the minimum value of $c.$ This is equivalent to finding the smallest $c$ such that $c + \frac{\pi}{2} = 3.$

## Step 1:  We are given the graph of the function $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$, and we need to find the smallest possible value of $c$ for which the graph of $y = a \sin (bx + c) + d$ is identical to the graph provided.

## Step 3:  Our goal is to find the smallest possible value of $c$ for which the graph is identical to the one provided.
## Step 4:  The period of the function $\sin \left( bx + \frac{\pi c}{a} \right)$ is $\frac{2 \pi}{b}$.

## Step 6:  Solving this equation, we find that $b = 1$.
## Step 7:  Now, we need to find the smallest possible value of $c$ that will give the same graph as the one provided.
## Step 8:  From the graph, we can see that the phase shift is $\frac{\pi}{b} = \frac{\pi}{1} = \pi$.
## Step 9:  This means that the graph can be shifted $\frac{\pi}{a}$ units to the left. Therefore, the equation of the graph is $\sin \left( x - \frac{\pi}{a} \right) + d$.
## Step 10:  To find the smallest possible value of $c$, we need to find the value of $\frac{\pi}{a}$ such that the graph of $\sin \left( x - \frac{\pi}{a} \right) + d$ is identical to the graph provided.
## Step 11:  The graph provided is $3$ units to the right of the x-axis. Therefore, to make the two graphs identical, we need to shift the graph of $\sin \left( x - \frac{\pi}{a} \right) + d$ to the right by $3$ units. This implies that $\frac{\pi}{a} = 3$.
## Step 12:  Solving this equation, we find that $a = \frac{1}{3}$.
## Step 13:  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $c$ is $\boxed{\frac{\pi}{3}}$.

## Step 8:  From the graph, we can see that the phase shift is $\frac{\pi}{b} = \frac{\pi}{1} = \pi$.
## Step 9:  This means that the graph can be shifted $\frac{\pi}{a}$ units to the left. Therefore, the equation of the graph is $\sin \left( x - \frac{\pi}{a} \right) + d$.
## Step 10:  To find the smallest possible value of $c$, we need to find the value of $\frac{\pi}{a}$ such that the graph of $\sin \left( x - \frac{\pi}{a} \right) + d$ is identical to the graph provided.
## Step 11:  The graph provided is $3$ units to the right of the x-axis. Therefore, to make the two graphs identical, we need to shift the graph of $\sin \left( x - \frac{\pi}{a} \right) + d$ to the right by $3$ units. This implies that $\frac{\pi}{a} = 3$.
## Step 12:  Solving this equation, we find that $a = \frac{1}{3}$.
## Step 13:  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $c$ is $\boxed{\frac{\pi}{3}}$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{\pi}{3}}$
